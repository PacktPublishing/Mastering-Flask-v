# Mastering Flask [Video]
This is the code repository for [Mastering Flask [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/mastering-flask-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781784393915), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Flask is a small and powerful web development framework for Python. It is called a micro-framework as it aims to keep the core simple but extensible. Even though it’s called a micro-framework, it is no way lacking in functionality, and allows you to develop applications very quickly, primarily through the development of a small codebase.

This course will take you deep into the world of using Flask and its ecosystem of extensions to create web applications. We’ll walk through creating a simple IMDB clone from scratch. We’ll start by creating the boilerplate code and use Virtualenv to create an isolated development environment. You’ll then learn to work with the database using SQLAlchemy. After that, we’ll display our data to the end user using WTForms.

We’ll restructure and modularize our code using Blueprints. Our site will be secured using the extensions Flask-Login and Flask-Principal. After that, we’ll create a RESTful API of our app. We’ll then give admin functionality and extend our app using various flask extensions. We’ll incorporate Celery to make our tasks asynchronous. We’ll walk you through performing unit test of our app, and then test our SQLAlchemy models. We’ll also test the URLs and finally, we’ll test how much of our code isn’t being tested. All these tests will make our app secure. Finally, we’ll deploy our Flask app to various options that are available.

This course will give you an in-depth understanding of how to use Flask and its strong extensibility for more complex web applications.
